## Introduction
Hey there, readers. Ever found yourself in a place you weren’t
supposed to be, overhearing something you weren't supposed to
hear? That happened to me once, and it made me think hard
about what I believe and why. Let me take you back to my
freshman year in high school.

## The Incident
So, I was in trouble. Nothing big, but I ended up sitting in this
office where only teachers go. That's when I overheard my history
teacher talking. She was super excited that her students were all
seeing the early pioneers not as heroes, but as oppressors.
Everyone was thinking the same way, and she loved it. I didn’t.
Disagreement with the Teacher's Perspective? Nope.

Now, you might think I was bothered because I disagreed with her
view. Pioneers as oppressors? Controversial, right? Nope, not for
me. I was totally on board with that. Violence and oppression in
settling North America? Absolutely, that happened. That wasn’t
the problem.

## Overhearing: Awkward, but Not the Issue
Did I feel weird about eavesdropping? Sure, a bit. I was in a room
where only teachers went, after all. It was kind of like stumbling
into a secret meeting. But that wasn't really what got to me.

## Groupthink: The Real Head-Scratcher
Here's what really bugged me: How could we all be “critical
thinkers” if we were all thinking the same way? That's what had
me tied in knots. My teacher wanted us to think for ourselves, but
then she was thrilled that we were all on the same page. It made
me wonder: Were my thoughts really mine? Or were they just
what I'd been taught?

## Conclusion
That day in the teacher's room was a turning point for me. Not
because I disagreed with the history lesson, or because I was
somewhere I shouldn't have been, but because I started to
question everything. If we were all thinking the same way, were
we really thinking at all?

I didn’t have all the answers then, and I still don’t. But I learned
something important: true critical thinking means questioning, not
just what others believe, but what you believe too. It’s about
finding your voice, even if it’s different from everyone else’s.
So here's to the thinkers, the questioners, the ones who aren't
afraid to go their own way. May we always strive to be one of
them.
