I ran into a local man selling baskets outside the town attorney's office not long ago. “Got some baskets here, you interested?” he questioned. The lawyer responded, “No, don't think we need any right now.” As the man left, he said, “So, you're just going to leave us hanging, huh?” He'd seen how others in the town seemed to have it easy—like the lawyer who talked for a living and somehow had money and respect flow to him. So, the man thought: Why not me? I can weave baskets, and once I make 'em, surely someone would buy 'em. He didn’t quite grasp that he had to make these baskets something folks wanted, or at least believed they needed, or maybe try something different altogether.

I can relate. I've crafted things, real fine-like, but I haven’t quite figured out how to get people to see the value in 'em. But for me, it wasn't just about selling them; it was more about finding a way not to rely on others to buy them. Everyone’s always talking about one way of living, but why's that one way better than any other?

Seeing that the townsfolk weren't about to offer me a spot in their circles or jobs, I thought, "Well, maybe the woods know me better." I decided to get down to business right away, even if I didn’t have much to start with. Going to Walden wasn’t about living cheap or expensive; it was about getting some personal stuff done without anyone getting in the way. Seemed a shame to let a lack of common sense or a bit of business know-how keep me from it.
